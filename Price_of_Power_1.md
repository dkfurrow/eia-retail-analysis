<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Price of Power</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">A More Balanced View of Retail Power Prices in Texas</h3>
######

I read with interest the front-page Wall Street Journal article "[Texas Electric Bills Were $28 Billion Higher Under Deregulation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-electric-bills-were-28-billion-higher-under-deregulation-11614162780?st=4669lbei6w8wzq0&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)" of February 24th of this year.  It promised an "analysis" of Texas retail power prices.  The headline graph and its title (reproduced here) seemed promising:
> ###Pricey Power###
> The roughly 60% of Texans who must choose a retail electricity provider consistently pay more than customers in the state who buy their power from traditional utilities.

The article then takes the price differential in this graph (elsewhere defined as a difference of 'average' prices for *residential customers only*), multiplies it by the amount of energy sold via retail providers, and *voila*: [28 *Billion Dollars*](https://youtu.be/BRAkobf-tVI?t=11).

Well, that seemed clear enough, except, as someone who regularly shops power suppliers as a retail consumer in Texas, the numbers seemed...suspiciously high.  For example, rummaging around in my records, I found:

Well, my 2018 contract renewal seemed to be considerably below *both* the 'Retail Provider' and 'Traditional Utility' numbers provided in the article.  Well, it's not as if this is some obscure marketing scheme--each year, when my contract expires, I go to the puc-sponsored website [powertochoose.org](http://powertochoose.org), choose "12-month, fixed price, sorted" and *choose the lowest price.*  Not a lot of brainpower involved there.  So I have a stack of these 'EFLs' over the last 10 years with similar results, all lower that this graph.

### Questions raised: ###
1. What is being compared here?  Who are the 'Traditional Utilities' and 'Retail Providers'?
2. So where is this data?  How can I analyze it myself?
3. Why are my results so different? What is meant by 'average' price?
4. What has gone on in the (roughly 2/3) of the market for commercial and industrial customers?
5. How can I place this $28 Billion in context?  What are some insights that can be gained from this data?

We will answer those questions in two parts.  This article will focus on questions 1-3, and a subsequent article will focus on 4-5.
