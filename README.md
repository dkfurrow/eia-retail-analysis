# Energy Information Agency (EIA) Retail Power Analysis

This is code related to the extraction, cleaning, and analysis of EIA data on retail power..

## Getting Started

You'll need a python installation of some kind that includes [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).  For windows I prefer [Winpython](https://winpython.github.io/) as it's easy to use and contains pandas in the distribution.  


### Prerequisites

It's not strictly necessary to run these scripts, but it's helpful to have a decent IDE, my favorite is [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/), especially when you use the [cell mode](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7858-pycharm-cell-mode) plugin.  

## Running the scripts
The scripts are basically self-explanatory.  The code is separated into blocks like those used in the [spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) ide.
